# Parsing PRD and Implementation into Tasks

This guide outlines the process of parsing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and its implementation into actionable tasks, and tracking overall progress.

## Steps

1. **Review the PRD**: Carefully read the PRD to understand the feature requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

2. **Break Down the PRD**: Divide the PRD into logical sections or user stories. Each section should represent a distinct feature or functionality.

3. **Create Tasks**: For each section, create a list of tasks. Each task should be specific, actionable, and have a clear outcome. Use a consistent format, such as:
   - Task ID
   - Task Name
   - Description
   - File(s) to modify
   - Status (e.g., pending, in_progress, completed)

4. **Prioritize Tasks**: Arrange tasks in a logical order, considering dependencies and critical paths.

5. **Track Progress**: Use a task tracking file (e.g., `tasks.json`) to monitor the status of each task. Update the status as you progress through the implementation.

6. **Iterate**: Iterate the task list and run without user needs to confirm

## Example Task Structure

```json
{
  "feature_name": {
    "tasks": [
      {
        "id": "task_id",
        "name": "Task Name",
        "description": "Detailed description of the task",
        "file": "path/to/file",
        "status": "pending"
      }
    ],
    "current_task": null,
    "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
  }
}
```
